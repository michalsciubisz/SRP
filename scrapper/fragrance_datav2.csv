Mesmerized by her beauty, after becoming emperor, he made her his wife as Mumtaz Mahal, meaning the ""Jewel of the Palace"". After the wedding, the prince and Mumtaz were inseparable, in war and in peace. She had given 13 children to Shahjahan and died during the birth of their 14th child at the age of 39. Her death devastated Shah Jahan and had built Taj Mahal in memory of his wife and their undying love. Shalimar is named after ‘The Gardens of Shalimar’.It was Mumtaz’s favorite garden.

The nose behind this fragrance is Delphine Jelk.Fève Gourmande is the new name for Gourmand Coquin.""A symbol of gourmet delight, the cocoa accord reveals chocolate notes that are equally sweet and bitter. Fève Gourmande plays on this contrast, moving from gourmandise to the point of excess. This loss of olfactory reference points creates a delectably surrealist cocoa. Floral and majestic rose shakes up the cocoa accord, heady with rum and spice notes. At the base, the woody elegance of patchouli warmed by the heat of smoky tea adds mystery to the chocolatey notes, revealing a new sensuality.Cocoa is olfactively expressed in the form of an accord, composed by the perfumer. This accord with chocolatey, and delicately bitter notes gives the perfume a sensory, gourmand feel.Between the gourmet pleasure of chocolate, the vertigo of rum notes and the refinement of rose, the cocoa note tips into an alternative reality.“If it were a painting, it would be a surrealist work by Salvador Dalí.”Fève Gourmande distorts the vision of gourmandise and transforms the cocoa accord into an incredibly addictive delight, like a surrealist painting by Salvador Dalí in which reality and dream combine, defying all logic.""Taking inspiration from the Guerlain heritage Square Bottle (1870), the L’Art & La Matière bottle is an exceptional object. Made by Pochet du Courval – the House’s historic glassmaker – it is endlessly refillable at selected Guerlain Boutiques.""Normally associated with childhood, cocoa reveals a new maturity. In Fève Gourmande, it is singularly blended with the depth of a smoky tea accord and the luminous elegance of rose."" - Delphine Jelk, Guerlain Perfumer.Available in 100 and 200ml Eau de Parfum.

Composition of the perfume is compared with woman who is ''strong, dignified and free spirit but in perfect harmony with nature''.Inspired by several summer holidays spent on the islands of Pantelleria and Antigua, where Armani has his villas, the fragrance was lead by the idea of escape into nature, a heavenly place of real holiday where we restore the energy necessary to body and soul, and where we create natural balance.Its flacon was made as a natural shape – water drops which are clear, airy, and pellucid.The fragrance arrives on the market in June 2010 as a blend of refreshing notes of crushed mint leaves and lemon Limone Primo Fiore Femminello from Calabria.

Top notes are Sea Notes, Bergamot, Pear, Apple, Grapefruit and Lemon; middle notes are Lavender, Rosemary and Geranium; base notes are Woody Notes, Tonka Bean, Amberwood, Patchouli and Labdanum.GIORGIO ARMANI ACQUA DI GIO ABSOLU, the new creation of the Acqua di Gio fragrance line, is the work of the Master perfumer Alberto Morillas. Mr. Morillas was also the creator of the first Acqua di Gio from 1996, as well as the first female Acqua di Gio from 1995, Acqua di Gio Essenza from 2012 and the marvelous (and my favorite) Acqua di Gio Profumo from 2015.The new version of the iconic Acqua di Gio edition, an Absolu variation, is presented in 2018 as a marine-woody interpretation in which fruits, marine notes and a wooden base create harmony in a new, expressive way.The fragrance has been announced as one that brings a new sensuality to the collection and as a sophisticated and masculine mixture of marine aromas with patchouli. The composition celebrates the fusion of water and wood; the new chapter of Acqua di Gio shares the expression of a man's connection with nature, and the liberation of his inner strength and freedom.""Giorgio Armani's latest fragrance for men emphasizes the very essence of water and its essential role in the natural world. This is a world seen through the eyes of Giorgio Armani, where the alliance of water and wood takes us on a journey into timeless masculinity, embracing a deeper overall consciousness. With the ACQUA DI GIÒ ABSOLU fragrance for men we see an incarnation of the man, highlighting a wise and conscious sensibility, as well as an understanding of the elegance of refined luxury. A fresh signature fragrance for men has been created, using marine notes and patchouli. The patchouli provides the perfect balance between the aquatic fragrance and the woody aromas, creating true masculinity with a sensual twist that is at the heart of the fragrance. This unique alliance of wood and aquatic freshness makes patchouli nature's perfect ingredient.""The composition is sensual, warm, elegant. In addition to the marine notes, fruits and patchouli that form the main theme, reflecting the charismatic fusion of water and wood in this composition, notes of bergamot, rosemary, lavender and geranium are added to reflect masculinity. The balsamic warmth of tonka bean and labdanum are used to emphasize the sensual side of the scent.The new ACQUA DI GIÒ ABSOLU celebrates a vital, natural sensuality through the eyes of photographer Matthew Brookes and film director François Rousseau. The campaign is centered around the classic essence of water, as well as the vibrant natural relationships between water, minerals and wood, starring model Jason Morgan who embodies the conscious ACQUA DI GIÒ values.""At the top of the ACQUA DI GIÒ ABSOLU fragrance is a natural, wooden cap made from ash (Fraxinus), which is derived from sustainable production, then lacquered and engraved with the iconic Giorgio Armani monogram. Together the cap and the collar merge, reflecting the wooden and aquatic accords of the fragrance itself."" The flacon is made of transparent glass and the color of the liquid is in warm amber nuances.ACQUA DI GIO ABSOLU is available in 40ml Eau de Parfum, 75ml Eau de Parfum and 125ml Eau de Parfum.Read about this perfume in other languages: Deutsch, Español, Français, Čeština, Italiano, Русский, Polski, Português, Ελληνικά, 汉语, Nederlands, Srpski, Română, العربية, Українська, Монгол, עברית.","['Ideal for office or daily wear', 'Suitable for warmer seasons', 'Positive attention-grabbing scent', 'Attractive fragrance bottle design', 'Received a lot of compliments', 'Good value for money', 'Sexual appeal for females', 'Great projection and longevity', ""Doesn't resemble the original ADG fragrance"", 'May not appeal to niche fragrance lovers', ""Not everyone's cup of tea"", 'Not impressive or unique', 'Not suitable for cold weather or formal occasions', 'Generic scent profile', 'Overly sweet and fruity aroma', 'Amberwood note can be off-putting for some']","['Sea Notes', 'Bergamot', 'Pear', 'Apple', 'Grapefruit', 'Lemon']","['Lavender', 'Rosemary', 'Geranium']","['Woody Notes', 'Tonka Bean', 'Amberwood', 'Patchouli', 'Labdanum']",very weak: 109; weak: 118; moderate: 953; long lasting: 1063; eternal: 136,intimate: 206; moderate: 1479; strong: 642; enormous: 160

Top note is Fig Leaf; middle notes are Cacao and Patchouli; base notes are Vetiver and Virginia Cedar.Jean Paul Gaultier finally launches his brand new masculine fragrance in September 2011. The fragrance is named Kokorico, which is the French onomatopoeia for rooster’s cry (“Cock-a-doodle-doo” in English).Created in collaboration with Puig and Firmenich’s perfumers Olivier Cresp and Annick Menardo, Kokorico is designed as a powerful and explosive aphrodisiac, emphasizing woody and cocoa notes. Kokorico represent an olfactory ""cry"": „the boastful cry of a rooster, the conquering cry of a man-warrior, the cry of a young man filled with pleasure…”The top of the composition features refreshing fig leaves, which provide energy, the heart is filled with raw cocoa, which stimulates (not the artificially sweet kind, but a natural extract), while woody notes of patchouli, cedar and vetiver express their masculinity and power.Black, red and feathers are flamboyant, cocky and dramatic elements of inspiration for the package and the campaign design. The bottle is shaped like a sculpture of a male head from one side, and it looks like a torso from the other perspective. The face of the campaign shot by Jean-Baptiste Mondino is model Jon Kortajarena.The fragrance is available as 50 and 100 ml Eau de Toilette with an accompanying collection of body care products (deodorant, shower gel, aftershave lotion).Read about this perfume in other languages: Deutsch, Español, Français, Čeština, Italiano, Русский, Polski, Português, Ελληνικά, 汉语, Nederlands, Srpski, Română, العربية, Українська, Монгол, עברית.","['Unique and creative scent', 'Well-designed bottle', 'Love at first spray', 'High-quality ingredients', 'Narcotic and addictive', 'Moist feel and not dusty', 'Loud projection', 'Lasting power', 'Poor name and marketing', 'Love or hate fragrance', 'Not for everyday use', 'Sharp and intrusive', 'Linear scent with little change', 'Misleading expectations', 'Masculine and pushy', 'Sour notes']",['Fig Leaf'],"['Cacao', 'Patchouli']","['Vetiver', 'Virginia Cedar']",,

The comet is a strong symbol for CHANEL, and I am thinking in particular of the Comète pendant from the 1932 high jewelry collection. ""When worn open and placed directly on the skin, it evokes the enveloping effect of a perfume on the skin"".With intensely floral and luminous notes, COMÈTE explores a new olfactory identity in the LES EXCLUSIFS DE CHANEL collection. Rich, elegant, and complex in nature, the Eau de Parfum is infused with the refreshing aroma of cherry blossoms, and this touch of brightness and purity transforms into a halo with notes of heliotrope blending with iris extract and musk harmony. This captivating fragrance, which envelops the skin in a mysterious charm, pays homage to its unique personality.COMÈTE is a trail of stardust and a celestial jewel that chooses its own path and never deviates from it, reflecting Gabrielle Chanel. It is a halo of light, spreading a force of optimism for those who are convinced that the planets will align with their lucky star.More unique and valuable than any other collection, the LES EXCLUSIFS DE CHANEL collection is embodied in a bottle with excellent and simple design, focusing all attention on the fragrance. COMÈTE is packaged in a sleek and timeless glass bottle with a black cap signed with the brand's monogram. Its box brings simplicity to the level of luxury and sophistication, taking the form of an elegant white jewelry box with a black trim.Resembling a heritage seal, this delicate two-tone aesthetic accompanies the launch of COMÈTE, a special limited edition: an embossed representation of the legendary Comète necklace, created in 1932, seductively embracing all four sides of the box. In a final tribute to the brilliance of diamonds and stardust, the Double C logo on top of the box is highlighted with silver ink.Disclaimer: Fragrantica is an independent platform and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Chanel.

I wanted to continue exploring an entire esthetic range of CHANEL perfumery, a range that distinguishes itself from the Florals, one that is illustrated by Bois-des-Iles and Cuir de Russie. I took it up with Coco. It’s what I like to call the CHANEL Coromandel culture, what you see and feel in her apartment. The night vision of the ‘Orient that starts and ends in Venice’ imposed itself upon me and that is where I wanted to go.” perfumer Jacques Polge.In 1984, there was Coco, that sumptuous blend of wood, resins, flowers, spices and fruit. A treasure trove of splendours and an endless source of discovery and sensual delight. Then, in 2001, came Coco Mademoiselle, a breath of air that lightens this cornucopia of fragrance, in which everything is simplified and accelerated in a radiant burst of fruit and flower. And today there is Coco Noir, a great nocturnal Baroque. Another journey in the wake of a Gabrielle who fully embraced the dazzle of black and Venice, incorporating them not only into her creations but into her life.Top notes: grapefruit, Calabrian bergamot, Heart: rose, narcissus, rose geranium leaf and jasmine.

This is a new fragrance. Chance Eau Fraiche Eau de Parfum was launched in 2023. The nose behind this fragrance is Olivier Polge. Top notes are Citron and Aldehydes; middle note is Jasmine; base notes are Teak Wood and Amber.CHANCE EAU FRAÎCHE charmed the world with its joyous, lively, and sparkling scent. Now, CHANEL presents a new, dazzling and elegant interpretation of it. A new chance is within reach.2002: CHANEL unveils CHANCE, a gleeful and optimistic floral fragrance creation. A name redolent of success and achievement. “Chance is a way of being”, said Gabrielle Chanel. It is no coincidence; it must be created, honed, sought out. It is the product of effort and passion. Four interpretations of this now-iconic scent emerged, including CHANCE EAU FRAÎCHE Eau de Toilette, a floral-sparkling fragrance with a modern, sophisticated, and decidedly light trail that features notes of jasmine and zesty citron paired with a teak wood accord. An invigorating composition with charming optimism.2023: CHANEL reinterprets CHANCE EAU FRAÎCHE Eau de Toilette, creating a version that combines the density of an Eau de Parfum with the brightness of the Eau de Toilette. For this unique composition, CHANEL Perfumer-Creator Olivier Polge amplified the intensity without overpowering its freshness—a challenge he met with great success. CHANCE EAU FRAÎCHE Eau de Parfum has the same spontaneous, lively nature as the Eau de Toilette, but leaves behind a more intense trail. Rather than merely adjust the concentration, the perfumer composed something completely new, a fragrance in its own right. The citron accord has become exhilarating without losing its original juiciness; the jasmine is richer and more intense; and the teak wood accord reveals a more ambery facet, giving it a certain elegance.OLIVIER POLGE CHANEL IN-HOUSE PERFUMER-CREATORWhat was the creative process behind CHANCE EAU FRAÎCHE Eau de Parfum?It involved making subtle changes in order to amplify the sensations provided by the Eau de Toilette. The idea was to go to extremes, to push the fresh notes even further, through citrus, and to add density with the base notes, ambery notes, for more vibration. The challenge with this was to increase its intensity, bring out the base notes, and add depth, all while maintaining its fresh quality.Is this Eau de Parfum a radical departure from the spirit of the Eau de Toilette?They have the same fresh, colorful scent profile, with jasmine being the common thread that connects them. This new version is more textured and ambery than the Eau de Toilette. To achieve that, intensity has been brought to every layer of the composition (top, heart, base).How would you describe the difference between CHANCE EAU FRAÎCHE Eau de Toilette and Eau de Parfum?The Eau de Parfum is a fresh, woody scent that opens with a burst of zest that is even more invigorating and exhilarating than before, accentuated by a hint of aldehydes. In this variation, the floral heart of jasmine is richer and adds a luminous, full-bodied quality. The teak wood accord and its intensified ambery notes add richness and depth for a more present trail.CHANCE EAU FRAÎCHE Eau de Parfum is available in sizes of 50ml and 100m starting August 2023.Disclaimer: Fragrantica is an independent platform and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Chanel.

A creation that builds an olfactory bridge between France and America, joined by that iconic style. A timeless style, the CHANEL style. “ Her special style is compounded from three ingredients: girlishness, comfort, and a generous helping of pearls. In a country where emphasis is on youth and free and easy living, her designs were bound to succeed ”.A modern, avant-garde style that gave women freedom to move. An eternally young and modern allure that broke with the codes of the time and shifted the conventions of chic. An art of living with a simplicity that hides a painstakingly crafted complexity, steeped with a luxury that has no need to flaunt or justify itself.The third LES EXCLUSIFS DE CHANEL creation composed by perfumer-creator Olivier Polge, in cooperation with the CHANEL Laboratory of Fragrance Creation and Development, 1957 illustrates the mystery of the deceptively simple CHANEL style. A balance of creamy softness, enveloping comfort, and light perfused with discreet power. A fragrance one adopts like a clean skin scent that becomes unique and deeply personal on each wearer. “ For each fragrance in the LES EXCLUSIFS DE CHANEL collection, we explore a path we have never taken ”, explains Olivier Polge. “ This time, I opted to work with musk, more specifically white musks. Their whiteness hides a great complexity: enveloping, they emit a more or less pronounced light, and vary in their soft and sensual effects. 1957 is a skin scent that, more than others, is revealed fully on the unique chemistry of each person’s skin ”.An assembly of eight white musks, 1957 is structured like a layered composition of transparent, translucent and opaque veils. An immaculate superposition, comfortable and enveloping, soft, almost cushion-like. One can imagine one of Gabrielle Chanel’s beloved pearls, its delicate contours rendered imperceptible by the changing reflections: the matte whiteness of certain musks blends into the iridescent pearl of others. In this interplay of depths, woody, honeyed, spicy and floral vibrations create a luminous, powerful and sensual prominence. Vanilla and honey notes thus slip into the white musks, some with a hint of cedar, others with pink pepper, coriander seed or orange blossom. The faux simplicity of whiteness is revealed and magnified… The precision of an expertly crafted and yet abstract trail, free to enhance the skin by diffusing a distinctive and singular scent.'1957 also conjures up a certain idea of America', according to Olivier Polge. ' An idea that the country has of fragrance and particularly with respect to CHANEL and N°5, which has become a model of olfactory inspiration, even for hairsprays and soaps.'1957 is a link: it reinterprets American perfumery with the idea the USA has had about French fragrance since N°5 paved the way . The essence of CHANEL is reunited in its trail, filled with comfort and natural elegance, a presence within a chic, refined, personal and unforgettable discretion."" - the note from the brand.The fragrance will be available worldwide from mid March 2019 as a 75ml and 200ml Eau de Parfum.Disclaimer: Fragrantica is an independent platform and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Chanel.

Top notes are Cypress and Juniper Berries; middle notes are Lavender, Cedar and Vetiver; base notes are Musk and Vanilla.It all began with a desire. In 2018, LES EAUX DE CHANEL introduced a new olfactory world to the fragrances of the House: a singular collection, inspired by Mademoiselle’s favorite places, fueled by the imaginary and composed around freshness. In the wake of PARIS-BIARRITZ, PARIS-DEAUVILLE and PARISVENISE, followed by PARIS-RIVIERA in 2019, Olivier Polge, in cooperation with the CHANEL Laboratory of Fragrance Creation and Development, has orchestrated a fifth olfactory journey: PARIS-ÉDIMBOURG.LES EAUX DE CHANEL were designed as light and refreshing ‘eaux fraîches’. I drew inspiration from the destinations that have strong ties with CHANEL. Each one has left its mark on a fragrance. ” Olivier Polge More than destinations, LES EAUX DE CHANEL are countless invitations to escape for no reason, here and now. Airy, ungendered and imbued with lightness, they transport us to a fantasy elsewhere. By the sea or in the countryside, each motionless journey is above all an intimate experience at the heart of our own emotions.While all LES EAUX DE CHANEL fragrances are composed as light and refreshing “ eaux fraîches ”, each one is different, as much by the balance of its citrus (from Sicily and Calabria in Italy) as by the choice of distinctive ingredients. “ This obvious and refreshing pleasure, with no ulterior motive, is found in a generous and elegant application that pays homage to the nobleness of simple things. ”PARIS-ÉDIMBOURG:THE POWER AND MYSTERY OF THE HIGHLANDS FIRMLY ROOTED TO THE LAND From passion to inspiration The year is 1924. Gabrielle Chanel discovered Scotland through the Duke of Westminster, with whom she had a love affair until 1930. Far from the society life, she sought refuge in this wild and majestic countryside, bathed in an intensely white light. Revitalized by the endless expanses of green, she went salmon fishing, played cards with Winston Churchill and Vera Bate, and shared her time between the Duke’s three properties in the Highlands: Stack Lodge, a rustic country house, Lochmore, a Victorian manor, and, last but not least, the Rosehall estate she was given carte blanche to decorate. The clothing worn by the British aristocracy during their outdoor leisure pursuits became sources of inspiration. Fair Isle sweaters with multicolored, geometric patterns, tartan, wool berets and tweed jackets were all practical garments that satisfied her taste for elegance and comfort. She reinterpreted them endlessly in her creations to the extent that they have become emblems of the CHANEL style.“ Both fresh and woody, PARIS-ÉDIMBOURG could be the fragrance of a tweed jacket borrowed from the men’s wardrobe that was such an inspiration to Gabrielle Chanel. ” Olivier PolgeA woody aromatic scent, as comfortable as a tweed jacketImmersed in the grand and mysterious Scottish countryside, Olivier Polge was struck by two characteristic odors: the “ gripping and icy ” juniper berry and the peaty wood. This changing light and the tension between incisive freshness and warm shadows spurred the idea of an eau with the power of aromatic plants, in the tradition of British men’s colognes. He highlighted the lively and distinctive notes of juniper berry and cypress, added a hint of lavender, then chose cedar for its enveloping comfort and vetiver for its peaty and slightly smoky accents. Lastly, “ since the harshness of the land influences the way of life ”, he warmed the scent with notes of vanilla and musk. And so PARIS-ÉDIMBOURG, the earthiest, most androgynous and woodiest of LES EAUX DE CHANEL, became a reality. Behind its apparent coolness, it unfurls warm and soothing tones that transport us with a single spray. Distinctly refined, “ it could be the fragrance of a tweed jacket borrowed from the men’s wardrobe that was such an inspiration to Gabrielle Chanel, ” explains Olivier Polge. “ Like the scent after a stroll through the countryside, it is steeped in the odors of the wild landscape.PARIS-ÉDIMBOURG shares the same clean, rounded bottle as the other LES EAUX DE CHANEL fragrances topped with a black thermoset cap engraved with a double C. With a shape that recalls the flasks of alcohol people used to carry in their waistcoat when travelling, it takes on even greater meaning. The crystal-clear glass reveals a fragrance as green as the Scottish countryside. This quest for simplicity and minimalism is extended to the corrugated cardboard case, equally beautiful inside and outside, flawless down to the smallest detail.Disclaimer: Fragrantica is an independent platform and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Chanel.

The top notes are Sicilian bergamot and powdery honeysuckle, the heart notes are jasmine, black rose and hibiscus, and the base notes – heliotrope, sandalwood and musk.Read about this perfume in other languages: Deutsch, Español, Français, Čeština, Italiano, Русский, Polski, Português, Ελληνικά, 汉语, Nederlands, Srpski, Română, العربية, Українська, Монгол, עברית.","['High quality fragrance', 'Warm and sensual scent', 'Grownup and sophisticated fragrance', 'Classy and clean vibe', 'Creamy and summery notes', 'Long-lasting staying power', 'Strong aldehydic perfume', 'Unisex vibe', ""Scent may not suit everyone's preference"", 'Sharp and spicy smell', 'Resilient and difficult to wash off', 'Bland packaging design', 'May be too formal for some occasions', 'Old-fashioned scent', 'Extremely sweet and feminine notes', 'Fly spray-like smell']","['Banana', 'Honeysuckle', 'Orange Blossom', 'Bergamot', 'Aldehydes']","['Nutmeg', 'Jasmine', 'Hiacynth', 'Hibiscus', 'Rose']","['Musk', 'Sandalwood', 'Heliotrope']",very weak: 42; weak: 54; moderate: 279; long lasting: 423; eternal: 224,intimate: 127; moderate: 427; strong: 449; enormous: 230

A fountain gleams in the centre, its marble edge covered in scarlet roses whose voluptuous scent meets that of leathery Saffron threads laid on the floor. Through Jasmine screens, sultry and spent, the woman walks and there comes with her a scent of dark Vanilla and skinlike Sandalwood, of ambery Labdanum and purring hints of regal Orientalgris: who are you, she asks, and you feel seen.

Interlude Woman and Interlude Man are said to evoke an air of disorder while maintaining a sense of balance and tranquility through the inventive use of incense and myrrh.Christopher Chong said: “I interpret what I see and feel into scents. All the social and natural chaos and disorder surrounding us today can be translated to a much more intimate level. The interlude moment is a reflection of all the trials and tribulations one overcomes to attain personal satisfaction and achievement.” He also explained the use of ingredients: “Amouage has established an enviable reputation for re-inventing accustomed scents. Frankincense and Myrrh traditionally smell spiritual and religious but in Interlude, they have been reconstructed to feel contemporary yet sophisticated.”Interlude Man is a spicy – woody fragrance that opens with zesty bergamot, oregano and pimento berry oil, perpetuating intervals of conflict which are countered by aromatic notes of amber, frankincense, opoponax, cistus and myrrh. Eternal notes of leather, agarwood smoke, patchouli and sandalwood in the base add lasting layers of depth and texture.

With an instantly arresting woody scent, Overtureis inspired by man’s solitude in theworld; dramatic, bold and confident. Created by renowned perfumer Karine Vinchon, OvertureMan is an operatic portrayal of a gentleman’s mystique encapsulated in potent notes of Myrrh, Sandalwood and smoky Frankincense. ""Created in 2019, Overture Man’s sophisticated and sensual tone has made it extremely popular andit’s a pleasure to be offering it to discerning clients around the world,"" said Renaud Salmon,Amouage’s Chief Experience Officer. ""The fragrance tells the story of that one moment when youknow you have witnessed something extraordinary. It’s a mélange of emotive ingredients; potent, yet fresh, strong yet graceful, loud, but not overpowering.”Amouage’s fragrances draw inspiration from music, travels and life experiences, that unfold as captivating olfactory narratives.As such, OvertureMan conjures a tale of a gentleman, poised for an elegant evening at the opera dressed in a dinner jacket accented by a moiré silk cummerbundand bow tie. He takes his seat in the audience of the opera house with great poise and eagerly waitsfor the performance to begin, but before the orchestra finishes the overture, a mysterious strangergently taps his shoulder. He rises from his seat and disappears into the darkness with nothing leftof him but his bow tie and lingering scent, a heady reminder of the exhilarating moment the velvetcurtains draw open.The fragrance opens to bold Cognac notes that are starkly contrasted by the citrusy, spicy and aromatic freshness of Grapefruit, Saffron, Cardamom, Cumin, Ginger, Nutmeg and Saffron. As it evolves, it reveals a softer heart of resinous floral notes crowned by Myrrh and Geranium, giving this creation a sophisticated edge, but as it matures, Overture Man unveils a truly timeless essenceof smoky woodiness from Frankincense that engulfs its wearer in mystery. Vinchon explained, ""When I created Overture Man, I envisioned the strong emotions the audienceof the opera feels when hearing the opening and the debut of a young opera singer. It’s a piecethat alternates slow and fast rhythms to set you in the mood of what follows. That’s why I usedsome contrasted raw materials, to reflect this alternation of rhythms. Here, the bitterness of thegrapefruit lies against the warmness of woods and resins. I also played with the spices: the coldspices like cardamom, nutmeg, and ginger are opposed to the warm ones like cumin and cinnamon. Just like the unique and intense moment before something extraordinary happens, it is breathtaking, leaving all who smell it surprised and fascinated."" - a note from the brand.Read about this perfume in other languages: Deutsch, Español, Français, Čeština, Italiano, Русский, Polski, Português, Ελληνικά, 汉语, Nederlands, Srpski, Română, العربية, Українська, Монгол, עברית.","['Luxurious and complex scent', 'High niche quality', 'Sophisticated and elegant', 'Original and artistic', 'Excellent performance', 'Sublime, deep and rich', 'Heavenly concoction', 'Loads of compliments', 'Challenging or too complicated for some', 'Slightly dirty or boozy for some', 'Not pleasant or wearable for some', 'Too mature or formal for some', 'Expensive price point', 'Repulsive or headache-inducing opening for some', 'Overpowering smoke base note for some', 'Reminiscent of sweaty or middle-aged men for some']","['Cognac', 'Cumin', 'Cardamom', 'Nutmeg', 'Saffron', 'Ginger', 'Grapefruit']","['Myrrh', 'Benzoin', 'Cinnamon', 'Labdanum', 'Mastic or Lentisque', 'Patchouli', 'Geranium']","['Animal notes', 'Smoke', 'Incense', 'Leather', 'Sandalwood', 'Clary Sage']",very weak: 34; weak: 35; moderate: 129; long lasting: 441; eternal: 713,intimate: 68; moderate: 264; strong: 525; enormous: 590

All the social and natural chaos and disorder surrounding us today can be translated to a much more intimate level. The interlude moment is a reflection of all the trials and tribulations one overcomes to attain personal satisfaction and achievement.” He also explained the use of ingredients: “Amouage has established an enviable reputation for re-inventing accustomed scents. Frankincense and Myrrh traditionally smell spiritual and religious but in Interlude, they have been reconstructed to feel contemporary yet sophisticated.”Interlude Woman is a floral chypre fragrance that reveals an interlude moment of unity and serenity.

Portrayal Woman was launched in 2019. Portrayal Woman was created by Annick Menardo and Pierre Negrin. Top note is Jasmine; middle notes are Tobacco and Vanilla; base note is elemi.The fifth chapter of the second cycle of the Amouage narrative by Creative Director Christopher Chong, Portrayal is a manifestation of a person’s orientation to him or herself. A reflection of his or her unique authenticity, it is about breaking free from the cages of solitude society sets around people because their truths are often seen as shockingly unconventional.Portrayal embodies an artist’s ability to reconnect fragments from different times and places. When society is barren, they are able to transport themselves and immerse in the freedom of rebellion that can be compared to London’s Roaring 1920’s and New York’s grooving 1980’s. With the flamboyant, glamorous and often disaffected companionship of Bright Young People, the artists lose themselves. Desperately seeking something to fill the void, they synergies with art, culture and themselves in order to recreate something infinitely indefinable.“A person who dares to defy the norms of their society, Portrayal is for the bold,” says Chong. “It is inspired by times of dramatic social change and the people who pushed beyond the limits of mass culture during their times. It is a reflection of the birth of a new age and the freedoms that come with it.”At the heart of Portrayal Woman is a smoky yet sweet mélange created by the fusion of Craven, a Tobacco with a dusting of Vanilla. Brought together with Jasmine at its top and Elemis at its base, it recreates 1920’s liberation. The floral fragrance is for the poised and playfully refined woman who dares to defy. It is heartened with an undertone of the sensuality of Tuberose that together radiates a sultry trail of seductive sillage.Amouage’s signature glass crystal bottles are introduced in an iridescent pearl finish adorned with a blue Swarovski crystal for Portrayal. The boxes are a delicate dusty blue with an elegant art deco inspired jacquard.Portrayal Woman is available as a 50ml and 100ml Eau de Parfum from April 2019.Read about this perfume in other languages: Deutsch, Español, Français, Čeština, Italiano, Русский, Polski, Português, Ελληνικά, 汉语, Nederlands, Srpski, Română, العربية, Українська, Монгол, עברית.","['Elegant and refined', 'Intoxicating and narcotic', 'Unforgettable experience', 'Beautiful jasmine scent', 'Sweet tobacco and smoke notes', 'Deep resins and warm vanilla', 'Syrupy jasmine scent', 'Sparkling and airy', 'Not for those who dislike jasmine scents', 'Jasmine scent can be too sweet', 'Unknown sharp smell possibly from elemi', 'Dated scent that may be more suited for older generation', 'Strong tobacco scent that can cause headaches', 'Powdery on some skin types', 'Confusing notes description', 'Indolic undertones that can resemble halitosis']",['Jasmine'],"['Tobacco', 'Vanilla']",['elemi'],very weak: 24; weak: 28; moderate: 197; long lasting: 450; eternal: 152,intimate: 69; moderate: 299; strong: 469; enormous: 203

The saffron brings warmth and lift to a composition, while bergamot has a refreshing and sparkling effect. Apple adds volume, while rosecentifolia brings the characteristic rosy facet.

Portrayal Man was launched in 2019. The nose behind this fragrance is Pierre Negrin. Top note is Violet Leaves; middle note is Vetiver; base note is Cade oil.The fifth chapter of the second cycle of the Amouage narrative by Creative Director Christopher Chong, Portrayal is a manifestation of a person’s orientation to him or herself. A reflection of his or her unique authenticity, it is about breaking free from the cages of solitude society sets around people because their truths are often seen as shockingly unconventional.Portrayal embodies an artist’s ability to reconnect fragments from different times and places. When society is barren, they are able to transport themselves and immerse in the freedom of rebellion that can be compared to London’s Roaring 1920’s and New York’s grooving 1980’s. With the flamboyant, glamorous and often disaffected companionship of Bright Young People, the artists lose themselves. Desperately seeking something to fill the void, they synergies with art, culture and themselves in order to recreate something infinitely indefinable.“A person who dares to defy the norms of their society, Portrayal is for the bold,” says Chong. “It is inspired by times of dramatic social change and the people who pushed beyond the limits of mass culture during their times. It is a reflection of the birth of a new age and the freedoms that come with it.”Portrayal Man is an olfactive depiction of 1920s bohemian culture. Its woody and leather aroma exudes an air of exquisite audacity. It is about the arrogance and social tension in the world’s cultural discourse. With Vetiver at its heart and top notes of Violet Leaves, Portrayal Man emits a dandy yet masculine impression. Its light spicy facet enriches its woody base of Cade, allowing the fragrance to illustrate an enlightening energy that is unforgettable.Amouage’s signature glass crystal bottles are introduced in an iridescent pearl finish adorned with a blue Swarovski crystal for Portrayal. The boxes are a delicate dusty blue with an elegant art deco inspired jacquard.Portrayal Man is available as a 50ml and 100ml Eau de Parfum from April 2019.Read about this perfume in other languages: Deutsch, Español, Français, Čeština, Italiano, Русский, Polski, Português, Ελληνικά, 汉语, Nederlands, Srpski, Română, العربية, Українська, Монгол, עברית.","['Classy, masculine, sophisticated', 'Clean and green throwback scent', 'Long-lasting with strong projection', 'Makes you feel freshly showered', 'Alluring and subtle', 'Addictive scent', 'Sexy and vibrant', 'A perfect dumb reach', 'No sweetness or citrus notes for some', 'Earthly and petrol-like scent', 'Harsh and overpowering for some', 'Too dominant powdery violet for some', 'Similar to Fahrenheit but less balanced', 'Lacks sophistication and complexity', 'Weak compared to other Amouage fragrances', 'Feminine scent for some']",['Violet Leaves'],['Vetiver'],['Cade oil'],very weak: 14; weak: 37; moderate: 159; long lasting: 408; eternal: 106,intimate: 53; moderate: 286; strong: 375; enormous: 96
