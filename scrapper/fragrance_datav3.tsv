The nose behind this fragrance is Delphine Jelk.Fève Gourmande is the new name for Gourmand Coquin."A symbol of gourmet delight, the cocoa accord reveals chocolate notes that are equally sweet and bitter. Fève Gourmande plays on this contrast, moving from gourmandise to the point of excess. This loss of olfactory reference points creates a delectably surrealist cocoa. Floral and majestic rose shakes up the cocoa accord, heady with rum and spice notes. At the base, the woody elegance of patchouli warmed by the heat of smoky tea adds mystery to the chocolatey notes, revealing a new sensuality.Cocoa is olfactively expressed in the form of an accord, composed by the perfumer. This accord with chocolatey, and delicately bitter notes gives the perfume a sensory, gourmand feel.Between the gourmet pleasure of chocolate, the vertigo of rum notes and the refinement of rose, the cocoa note tips into an alternative reality.“If it were a painting, it would be a surrealist work by Salvador Dalí.”Fève Gourmande distorts the vision of gourmandise and transforms the cocoa accord into an incredibly addictive delight, like a surrealist painting by Salvador Dalí in which reality and dream combine, defying all logic."Taking inspiration from the Guerlain heritage Square Bottle (1870), the L’Art & La Matière bottle is an exceptional object. Made by Pochet du Courval – the House’s historic glassmaker – it is endlessly refillable at selected Guerlain Boutiques."Normally associated with childhood, cocoa reveals a new maturity. In Fève Gourmande, it is singularly blended with the depth of a smoky tea accord and the luminous elegance of rose." - Delphine Jelk, Guerlain Perfumer.Available in 100 and 200ml Eau de Parfum.

It opens with playful and sparkling aromas of black cherry, bergamot, red berries and almond. Bulgarian and Turkish roses rule the heart, further developing with notes of licorice and smoked black tea. Aniseed, tonka bean, vanilla, iris and patchouli form the base.The bottles of La Petite Robe Noire collection are replicas of the classical vials of the house, such as L'Heure Bleue. The dress print has been altered so that each of the past three bottles shows a different shape of this clothing. The animated ad campaign was created by French artists Olivier Kuntzel and Florence Deygas.The new La Petite Robe Noire is available as 30, 50 and 75 ml Eau de Parfum.

Composition of the perfume is compared with woman who is ''strong, dignified and free spirit but in perfect harmony with nature''.Inspired by several summer holidays spent on the islands of Pantelleria and Antigua, where Armani has his villas, the fragrance was lead by the idea of escape into nature, a heavenly place of real holiday where we restore the energy necessary to body and soul, and where we create natural balance.Its flacon was made as a natural shape – water drops which are clear, airy, and pellucid.The fragrance arrives on the market in June 2010 as a blend of refreshing notes of crushed mint leaves and lemon Limone Primo Fiore Femminello from Calabria. Structure of the composition pushes the limits from fresh citruses to a floral heart which encompasses aquatic jasmine, dewy peony and pink pepper, while a base closes with cedar, yellow sugar and labdanum. Acqua di Gioia was created by three perfumers: Loc Dong, Anne Flipo and Dominique Ropion, who see it as Eve's seduction and as fragrance turned completely towards the nature.The perfume can be purchased as 30, 50 and 100 ml EDP, along with 200 ml body lotion.

After initially drawing attention, sparkling and radiant pear brightens the iconic juicy blackcurrant to add boldness. A floral heart beats passionately with rose and feminine jasmine to create a powerful scent, like a seemingly fragile woman who shows incredible strength when guided by passion.

A fresh signature fragrance for men has been created, using marine notes and patchouli. The patchouli provides the perfect balance between the aquatic fragrance and the woody aromas, creating true masculinity with a sensual twist that is at the heart of the fragrance. This unique alliance of wood and aquatic freshness makes patchouli nature's perfect ingredient."The composition is sensual, warm, elegant. In addition to the marine notes, fruits and patchouli that form the main theme, reflecting the charismatic fusion of water and wood in this composition, notes of bergamot, rosemary, lavender and geranium are added to reflect masculinity. The balsamic warmth of tonka bean and labdanum are used to emphasize the sensual side of the scent.The new ACQUA DI GIÒ ABSOLU celebrates a vital, natural sensuality through the eyes of photographer Matthew Brookes and film director François Rousseau.

Top note is Fig Leaf; middle notes are Cacao and Patchouli; base notes are Vetiver and Virginia Cedar.Jean Paul Gaultier finally launches his brand new masculine fragrance in September 2011. The fragrance is named Kokorico, which is the French onomatopoeia for rooster’s cry (“Cock-a-doodle-doo” in English).Created in collaboration with Puig and Firmenich’s perfumers Olivier Cresp and Annick Menardo, Kokorico is designed as a powerful and explosive aphrodisiac, emphasizing woody and cocoa notes. Kokorico represent an olfactory "cry": „the boastful cry of a rooster, the conquering cry of a man-warrior, the cry of a young man filled with pleasure…”The top of the composition features refreshing fig leaves, which provide energy, the heart is filled with raw cocoa, which stimulates (not the artificially sweet kind, but a natural extract), while woody notes of patchouli, cedar and vetiver express their masculinity and power.Black, red and feathers are flamboyant, cocky and dramatic elements of inspiration for the package and the campaign design. The bottle is shaped like a sculpture of a male head from one side, and it looks like a torso from the other perspective. The face of the campaign shot by Jean-Baptiste Mondino is model Jon Kortajarena.The fragrance is available as 50 and 100 ml Eau de Toilette with an accompanying collection of body care products (deodorant, shower gel, aftershave lotion).

Based on this philosophy, Kemi is the collection of unique perfumes created from pure natural raw elements through cryptic distillation techniques. Perfume as we know it could not have taken shape without alchemic studies and practices or skilfully converting ordinary inputs into noble substances. Kemi straddles the line between the tangible and the intangible, the earthly and the ethereal, the real and the magical.Aqua Regia evokes all that is noble in the alchemic world. Conjuring up the dazzle of gold and the resilience of platinum, it casts a powerful spell over everything it touches. Dignified and masterful, this unique scent blends distinctive eucalyptus with fresh bergamot, vetiver and rose. Kemi is a collection of perfumes created from natural raw elements using innovative distillation techniques.OLFACTORY NOTESLeather, Blackcurrant , Bergamot Reggio CalabriaViolet , Italian Tuscan Orris , Caramel , Patchouli From SingaporeVanilla From Madagascar, Musk , Cedar		['Leather', 'Black Currant', 'Calabrian bergamot']	['Violet', 'Orris Root', 'Singapore Patchouli', 'Caramel']	['Cedar', 'Musk', 'Madagascar Vanilla']

Top notes are Cherry Blossom and Aldehydes; middle notes are Iris and Heliotrope; base note is Musk.Olivier Polge asserts: "At the beginning of each creation, an element of inspiration is necessary and, in COMÈTE, the starting point was the idea of stardust. The comet is a strong symbol for CHANEL, and I am thinking in particular of the Comète pendant from the 1932 high jewelry collection. "When worn open and placed directly on the skin, it evokes the enveloping effect of a perfume on the skin".With intensely floral and luminous notes, COMÈTE explores a new olfactory identity in the LES EXCLUSIFS DE CHANEL collection. Rich, elegant, and complex in nature, the Eau de Parfum is infused with the refreshing aroma of cherry blossoms, and this touch of brightness and purity transforms into a halo with notes of heliotrope blending with iris extract and musk harmony. This captivating fragrance, which envelops the skin in a mysterious charm, pays homage to its unique personality.COMÈTE is a trail of stardust and a celestial jewel that chooses its own path and never deviates from it, reflecting Gabrielle Chanel. It is a halo of light, spreading a force of optimism for those who are convinced that the planets will align with their lucky star.More unique and valuable than any other collection, the LES EXCLUSIFS DE CHANEL collection is embodied in a bottle with excellent and simple design, focusing all attention on the fragrance. COMÈTE is packaged in a sleek and timeless glass bottle with a black cap signed with the brand's monogram. Its box brings simplicity to the level of luxury and sophistication, taking the form of an elegant white jewelry box with a black trim.Resembling a heritage seal, this delicate two-tone aesthetic accompanies the launch of COMÈTE, a special limited edition: an embossed representation of the legendary Comète necklace, created in 1932, seductively embracing all four sides of the box. In a final tribute to the brilliance of diamonds and stardust, the Double C logo on top of the box is highlighted with silver ink.Disclaimer: Fragrantica is an independent platform and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Chanel.

I wanted to continue exploring an entire esthetic range of CHANEL perfumery, a range that distinguishes itself from the Florals, one that is illustrated by Bois-des-Iles and Cuir de Russie. I took it up with Coco. It’s what I like to call the CHANEL Coromandel culture, what you see and feel in her apartment. The night vision of the ‘Orient that starts and ends in Venice’ imposed itself upon me and that is where I wanted to go.” perfumer Jacques Polge.In 1984, there was Coco, that sumptuous blend of wood, resins, flowers, spices and fruit. A treasure trove of splendours and an endless source of discovery and sensual delight. Then, in 2001, came Coco Mademoiselle, a breath of air that lightens this cornucopia of fragrance, in which everything is simplified and accelerated in a radiant burst of fruit and flower. And today there is Coco Noir, a great nocturnal Baroque. Another journey in the wake of a Gabrielle who fully embraced the dazzle of black and Venice, incorporating them not only into her creations but into her life.Top notes: grapefruit, Calabrian bergamot, Heart: rose, narcissus, rose geranium leaf and jasmine.

Top notes are Citron and Aldehydes; middle note is Jasmine; base notes are Teak Wood and Amber.CHANCE EAU FRAÎCHE charmed the world with its joyous, lively, and sparkling scent. Now, CHANEL presents a new, dazzling and elegant interpretation of it. A new chance is within reach.2002: CHANEL unveils CHANCE, a gleeful and optimistic floral fragrance creation. A name redolent of success and achievement. “Chance is a way of being”, said Gabrielle Chanel. It is no coincidence; it must be created, honed, sought out. It is the product of effort and passion. Four interpretations of this now-iconic scent emerged, including CHANCE EAU FRAÎCHE Eau de Toilette, a floral-sparkling fragrance with a modern, sophisticated, and decidedly light trail that features notes of jasmine and zesty citron paired with a teak wood accord. An invigorating composition with charming optimism.2023: CHANEL reinterprets CHANCE EAU FRAÎCHE Eau de Toilette, creating a version that combines the density of an Eau de Parfum with the brightness of the Eau de Toilette. For this unique composition, CHANEL Perfumer-Creator Olivier Polge amplified the intensity without overpowering its freshness—a challenge he met with great success. CHANCE EAU FRAÎCHE Eau de Parfum has the same spontaneous, lively nature as the Eau de Toilette, but leaves behind a more intense trail. Rather than merely adjust the concentration, the perfumer composed something completely new, a fragrance in its own right. The citron accord has become exhilarating without losing its original juiciness; the jasmine is richer and more intense; and the teak wood accord reveals a more ambery facet, giving it a certain elegance.OLIVIER POLGE CHANEL IN-HOUSE PERFUMER-CREATORWhat was the creative process behind CHANCE EAU FRAÎCHE Eau de Parfum?It involved making subtle changes in order to amplify the sensations provided by the Eau de Toilette. The idea was to go to extremes, to push the fresh notes even further, through citrus, and to add density with the base notes, ambery notes, for more vibration. The challenge with this was to increase its intensity, bring out the base notes, and add depth, all while maintaining its fresh quality.Is this Eau de Parfum a radical departure from the spirit of the Eau de Toilette?They have the same fresh, colorful scent profile, with jasmine being the common thread that connects them. This new version is more textured and ambery than the Eau de Toilette. To achieve that, intensity has been brought to every layer of the composition (top, heart, base).How would you describe the difference between CHANCE EAU FRAÎCHE Eau de Toilette and Eau de Parfum?The Eau de Parfum is a fresh, woody scent that opens with a burst of zest that is even more invigorating and exhilarating than before, accentuated by a hint of aldehydes. In this variation, the floral heart of jasmine is richer and adds a luminous, full-bodied quality. The teak wood accord and its intensified ambery notes add richness and depth for a more present trail.CHANCE EAU FRAÎCHE Eau de Parfum is available in sizes of 50ml and 100m starting August 2023.Disclaimer: Fragrantica is an independent platform and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Chanel.

A creation that builds an olfactory bridge between France and America, joined by that iconic style. A timeless style, the CHANEL style. “ Her special style is compounded from three ingredients: girlishness, comfort, and a generous helping of pearls. In a country where emphasis is on youth and free and easy living, her designs were bound to succeed ”.A modern, avant-garde style that gave women freedom to move. An eternally young and modern allure that broke with the codes of the time and shifted the conventions of chic. An art of living with a simplicity that hides a painstakingly crafted complexity, steeped with a luxury that has no need to flaunt or justify itself.The third LES EXCLUSIFS DE CHANEL creation composed by perfumer-creator Olivier Polge, in cooperation with the CHANEL Laboratory of Fragrance Creation and Development, 1957 illustrates the mystery of the deceptively simple CHANEL style. A balance of creamy softness, enveloping comfort, and light perfused with discreet power. A fragrance one adopts like a clean skin scent that becomes unique and deeply personal on each wearer. “ For each fragrance in the LES EXCLUSIFS DE CHANEL collection, we explore a path we have never taken ”, explains Olivier Polge. “ This time, I opted to work with musk, more specifically white musks. Their whiteness hides a great complexity: enveloping, they emit a more or less pronounced light, and vary in their soft and sensual effects. 1957 is a skin scent that, more than others, is revealed fully on the unique chemistry of each person’s skin ”.An assembly of eight white musks, 1957 is structured like a layered composition of transparent, translucent and opaque veils. An immaculate superposition, comfortable and enveloping, soft, almost cushion-like. One can imagine one of Gabrielle Chanel’s beloved pearls, its delicate contours rendered imperceptible by the changing reflections: the matte whiteness of certain musks blends into the iridescent pearl of others. In this interplay of depths, woody, honeyed, spicy and floral vibrations create a luminous, powerful and sensual prominence. Vanilla and honey notes thus slip into the white musks, some with a hint of cedar, others with pink pepper, coriander seed or orange blossom. The faux simplicity of whiteness is revealed and magnified… The precision of an expertly crafted and yet abstract trail, free to enhance the skin by diffusing a distinctive and singular scent.'1957 also conjures up a certain idea of America', according to Olivier Polge. ' An idea that the country has of fragrance and particularly with respect to CHANEL and N°5, which has become a model of olfactory inspiration, even for hairsprays and soaps.'1957 is a link: it reinterprets American perfumery with the idea the USA has had about French fragrance since N°5 paved the way . The essence of CHANEL is reunited in its trail, filled with comfort and natural elegance, a presence within a chic, refined, personal and unforgettable discretion." - the note from the brand.The fragrance will be available worldwide from mid March 2019 as a 75ml and 200ml Eau de Parfum.Disclaimer: Fragrantica is an independent platform and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Chanel.

GABRIELLE CHANEL PARFUM is an intense and multi-faceted floral composition, in which jasmine, ylang-ylang, orange blossom and tuberose from Grasse unfold in turn. Considered the most bewitching of all flowers, Grasse tuberose is obtained by a unique extraction process that captures the freshness of its petals. Its floral heart, surrounded by the comfort of sandalwood and vanilla absolute, makes it a particularly sensual composition.For Olivier Polge, Perfumer-Creator of Maison CHANEL, “GABRIELLE CHANEL PARFUM is a floral jewel. The most precious expression of GABRIELLE CHANEL, which will leave no one indifferent, like the woman who wears it”.The Inspiration“I chose what I wanted to be and I am”. (Gabrielle Chanel)Before being the name of a perfume, Gabrielle is the first name of a woman: Coco Chanel. A woman who made history by changing the rules. GABRIELLE CHANEL is the fragrance of a free and passionate woman, who asserts herself and who decides her destiny.The Art of PerfumeThe GABRIELLE CHANEL PARFUM bottle was designed with a vaporizer for an intensely feminine fragrance.

Paris – Édimbourg was launched in 2021. The nose behind this fragrance is Olivier Polge. Top notes are Cypress and Juniper Berries; middle notes are Lavender, Cedar and Vetiver; base notes are Musk and Vanilla.It all began with a desire. In 2018, LES EAUX DE CHANEL introduced a new olfactory world to the fragrances of the House: a singular collection, inspired by Mademoiselle’s favorite places, fueled by the imaginary and composed around freshness. In the wake of PARIS-BIARRITZ, PARIS-DEAUVILLE and PARISVENISE, followed by PARIS-RIVIERA in 2019, Olivier Polge, in cooperation with the CHANEL Laboratory of Fragrance Creation and Development, has orchestrated a fifth olfactory journey: PARIS-ÉDIMBOURG.LES EAUX DE CHANEL were designed as light and refreshing ‘eaux fraîches’. I drew inspiration from the destinations that have strong ties with CHANEL. Each one has left its mark on a fragrance. ” Olivier Polge More than destinations, LES EAUX DE CHANEL are countless invitations to escape for no reason, here and now. Airy, ungendered and imbued with lightness, they transport us to a fantasy elsewhere. By the sea or in the countryside, each motionless journey is above all an intimate experience at the heart of our own emotions.While all LES EAUX DE CHANEL fragrances are composed as light and refreshing “ eaux fraîches ”, each one is different, as much by the balance of its citrus (from Sicily and Calabria in Italy) as by the choice of distinctive ingredients. “ This obvious and refreshing pleasure, with no ulterior motive, is found in a generous and elegant application that pays homage to the nobleness of simple things. ”PARIS-ÉDIMBOURG:THE POWER AND MYSTERY OF THE HIGHLANDS FIRMLY ROOTED TO THE LAND From passion to inspiration The year is 1924. Gabrielle Chanel discovered Scotland through the Duke of Westminster, with whom she had a love affair until 1930. Far from the society life, she sought refuge in this wild and majestic countryside, bathed in an intensely white light. Revitalized by the endless expanses of green, she went salmon fishing, played cards with Winston Churchill and Vera Bate, and shared her time between the Duke’s three properties in the Highlands: Stack Lodge, a rustic country house, Lochmore, a Victorian manor, and, last but not least, the Rosehall estate she was given carte blanche to decorate. The clothing worn by the British aristocracy during their outdoor leisure pursuits became sources of inspiration. Fair Isle sweaters with multicolored, geometric patterns, tartan, wool berets and tweed jackets were all practical garments that satisfied her taste for elegance and comfort. She reinterpreted them endlessly in her creations to the extent that they have become emblems of the CHANEL style.“ Both fresh and woody, PARIS-ÉDIMBOURG could be the fragrance of a tweed jacket borrowed from the men’s wardrobe that was such an inspiration to Gabrielle Chanel. ” Olivier PolgeA woody aromatic scent, as comfortable as a tweed jacketImmersed in the grand and mysterious Scottish countryside, Olivier Polge was struck by two characteristic odors: the “ gripping and icy ” juniper berry and the peaty wood. This changing light and the tension between incisive freshness and warm shadows spurred the idea of an eau with the power of aromatic plants, in the tradition of British men’s colognes. He highlighted the lively and distinctive notes of juniper berry and cypress, added a hint of lavender, then chose cedar for its enveloping comfort and vetiver for its peaty and slightly smoky accents. Lastly, “ since the harshness of the land influences the way of life ”, he warmed the scent with notes of vanilla and musk. And so PARIS-ÉDIMBOURG, the earthiest, most androgynous and woodiest of LES EAUX DE CHANEL, became a reality. Behind its apparent coolness, it unfurls warm and soothing tones that transport us with a single spray. Distinctly refined, “ it could be the fragrance of a tweed jacket borrowed from the men’s wardrobe that was such an inspiration to Gabrielle Chanel, ” explains Olivier Polge. “ Like the scent after a stroll through the countryside, it is steeped in the odors of the wild landscape.PARIS-ÉDIMBOURG shares the same clean, rounded bottle as the other LES EAUX DE CHANEL fragrances topped with a black thermoset cap engraved with a double C. With a shape that recalls the flasks of alcohol people used to carry in their waistcoat when travelling, it takes on even greater meaning. The crystal-clear glass reveals a fragrance as green as the Scottish countryside. This quest for simplicity and minimalism is extended to the corrugated cardboard case, equally beautiful inside and outside, flawless down to the smallest detail.Disclaimer: Fragrantica is an independent platform and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Chanel.

Angels' Share was launched in 2020. The nose behind this fragrance is Benoist Lapouza. Top note is Cognac; middle notes are Cinnamon, Tonka Bean, Oak and Hedione; base notes are Vanilla, Praline, Sandalwood and Candied Almond."Introducing a new olfactive family, Kilian Hennessy pays tribute to his heritage, as heir to the renowned French cognac-making family, and to his choice olfactory intoxicants for driving the night towards dawn.A first-time collaboration with French perfumer Benoit Lapouza, the perfume Angel's Share is Kilian Hennessy's most personal fragrance creation yet, inspired by his eighth-generation inheritance of Hennessy savoir-faire in cognac making. The perfume goes deep into the cellars of founder's mind and memory, and into its most mysterious dimension: "la part des anges" or "angels' share"— an evaporation of liquor in oak barrels that lifts, while aging, like a silent offering to the gods.Much like a Master Perfumer who crafts accords and essences in a perfume, a Master Blender combines the eaux-de-vie in perfect proportions for an exceptional cognac. Angels' Share contains the essence of Cognac derived from the liquor to lend it a natural caramel color. Opening with cognac oil, upon a blend of oak absolute, cinnamon essence and Tonka bean absolute, the scent's long-lasting notes of sandalwood, praline and vanilla make for a delicious finish, a rare concoction only angels should experience."Notes: Cognac, Tonka Bean and Oak wood.

A spellbinding and novel interpretation of the Amouage triad of Rose, Frankincense and Orientalgris, Guidance reads like a poem, smells like an embrace, and feels like a word of wisdom.

All the social and natural chaos and disorder surrounding us today can be translated to a much more intimate level. The interlude moment is a reflection of all the trials and tribulations one overcomes to attain personal satisfaction and achievement.” He also explained the use of ingredients: “Amouage has established an enviable reputation for re-inventing accustomed scents. Frankincense and Myrrh traditionally smell spiritual and religious but in Interlude, they have been reconstructed to feel contemporary yet sophisticated.”Interlude Man is a spicy – woody fragrance that opens with zesty bergamot, oregano and pimento berry oil, perpetuating intervals of conflict which are countered by aromatic notes of amber, frankincense, opoponax, cistus and myrrh. Eternal notes of leather, agarwood smoke, patchouli and sandalwood in the base add lasting layers of depth and texture.

With an instantly arresting woody scent, Overtureis inspired by man’s solitude in theworld; dramatic, bold and confident. Created by renowned perfumer Karine Vinchon, OvertureMan is an operatic portrayal of a gentleman’s mystique encapsulated in potent notes of Myrrh, Sandalwood and smoky Frankincense. "Created in 2019, Overture Man’s sophisticated and sensual tone has made it extremely popular andit’s a pleasure to be offering it to discerning clients around the world," said Renaud Salmon,Amouage’s Chief Experience Officer. "The fragrance tells the story of that one moment when youknow you have witnessed something extraordinary. It’s a mélange of emotive ingredients; potent, yet fresh, strong yet graceful, loud, but not overpowering.”Amouage’s fragrances draw inspiration from music, travels and life experiences, that unfold as captivating olfactory narratives.As such, OvertureMan conjures a tale of a gentleman, poised for an elegant evening at the opera dressed in a dinner jacket accented by a moiré silk cummerbundand bow tie. He takes his seat in the audience of the opera house with great poise and eagerly waitsfor the performance to begin, but before the orchestra finishes the overture, a mysterious strangergently taps his shoulder. He rises from his seat and disappears into the darkness with nothing leftof him but his bow tie and lingering scent, a heady reminder of the exhilarating moment the velvetcurtains draw open.The fragrance opens to bold Cognac notes that are starkly contrasted by the citrusy, spicy and aromatic freshness of Grapefruit, Saffron, Cardamom, Cumin, Ginger, Nutmeg and Saffron. As it evolves, it reveals a softer heart of resinous floral notes crowned by Myrrh and Geranium, giving this creation a sophisticated edge, but as it matures, Overture Man unveils a truly timeless essenceof smoky woodiness from Frankincense that engulfs its wearer in mystery. Vinchon explained, "When I created Overture Man, I envisioned the strong emotions the audienceof the opera feels when hearing the opening and the debut of a young opera singer. It’s a piecethat alternates slow and fast rhythms to set you in the mood of what follows. That’s why I usedsome contrasted raw materials, to reflect this alternation of rhythms. Here, the bitterness of thegrapefruit lies against the warmness of woods and resins. I also played with the spices: the coldspices like cardamom, nutmeg, and ginger are opposed to the warm ones like cumin and cinnamon. Just like the unique and intense moment before something extraordinary happens, it is breathtaking, leaving all who smell it surprised and fascinated." - a note from the brand.

All the social and natural chaos and disorder surrounding us today can be translated to a much more intimate level. The interlude moment is a reflection of all the trials and tribulations one overcomes to attain personal satisfaction and achievement.” He also explained the use of ingredients: “Amouage has established an enviable reputation for re-inventing accustomed scents. Frankincense and Myrrh traditionally smell spiritual and religious but in Interlude, they have been reconstructed to feel contemporary yet sophisticated.”Interlude Woman is a floral chypre fragrance that reveals an interlude moment of unity and serenity. The sweetness of bergamot and bitterness of grapefruit in the top notes (together with ginger and tagete) create turbulent tensions while rose, frankincense, jasmine, orange blossom, helichrysum, opoponax and sandalwood in the intricate heart are masqueraded with an unconventional combination of nut, coffee, kiwi, honey and agarwood. An opulent base of sumptuous vanilla, benzoin, amber, sandalwood, oakmoss, leather, tonka and musk inject warmth to the fragrance’s contradicting accords.

Portrayal Woman was launched in 2019. Portrayal Woman was created by Annick Menardo and Pierre Negrin. Top note is Jasmine; middle notes are Tobacco and Vanilla; base note is elemi.The fifth chapter of the second cycle of the Amouage narrative by Creative Director Christopher Chong, Portrayal is a manifestation of a person’s orientation to him or herself. A reflection of his or her unique authenticity, it is about breaking free from the cages of solitude society sets around people because their truths are often seen as shockingly unconventional.Portrayal embodies an artist’s ability to reconnect fragments from different times and places. When society is barren, they are able to transport themselves and immerse in the freedom of rebellion that can be compared to London’s Roaring 1920’s and New York’s grooving 1980’s. With the flamboyant, glamorous and often disaffected companionship of Bright Young People, the artists lose themselves. Desperately seeking something to fill the void, they synergies with art, culture and themselves in order to recreate something infinitely indefinable.“A person who dares to defy the norms of their society, Portrayal is for the bold,” says Chong. “It is inspired by times of dramatic social change and the people who pushed beyond the limits of mass culture during their times. It is a reflection of the birth of a new age and the freedoms that come with it.”At the heart of Portrayal Woman is a smoky yet sweet mélange created by the fusion of Craven, a Tobacco with a dusting of Vanilla. Brought together with Jasmine at its top and Elemis at its base, it recreates 1920’s liberation. The floral fragrance is for the poised and playfully refined woman who dares to defy. It is heartened with an undertone of the sensuality of Tuberose that together radiates a sultry trail of seductive sillage.Amouage’s signature glass crystal bottles are introduced in an iridescent pearl finish adorned with a blue Swarovski crystal for Portrayal. The boxes are a delicate dusty blue with an elegant art deco inspired jacquard.Portrayal Woman is available as a 50ml and 100ml Eau de Parfum from April 2019.

To be in the presence ofOverture Womanis to bear witness to the extraordinary."As the new phase for Amouage continues to unfold, we are delighted to be pushing theboundaries of fragrance creation, while maintaining the brand’s precedence for exceptional qualityand craftmanship," said Renaud Salmon, Amouage’s Chief Experience Officer. "Standing on stageacross from Overture Man, Overture Woman is a timeless performance of elegance and grandeur immortalised in scent. At its heart is a sophisticated, confident and well-travelled discerning woman who seeks something compellingly precious, and personal." Completing the Overture narrative, Overture Woman tells the story of a confident young operaunderstudy who is given an opportunity of a lifetime, jumping in on a few hours' notice for an ailing principal.

Wearing hundreds of layers of silk organza, with a structuredpearls and beads-embellished harness, she has chosen to match it with long, dramatic, greigeleather gloves, completing her dreamy ensemble. She takes a breath; she won’t shy away from theweight of the very high-profile role she's inherited.

As the fragrance matures,Frankincense, together with Labdanum and leather at its base, bring a timeless sophistication to Overture Woman. Menardo explained, "When creating a perfume, I believe the inspiration behind it is every bit as important as the ingredients. A fragrance is good when the accord surprises me. The pillars arethere, they answer one another, I see the pattern, I feel the melody. And it’s this melody, this ideaof an operatic infusion, that inspired Overture Woman. The saffron brings warmth and lift to a composition, while bergamot has a refreshing and sparkling effect. Apple adds volume, while rosecentifolia brings the characteristic rosy facet. Like instruments, the individual notes are dissonant,but when they are composed, they offer a lyrical harmony." - a note from the brand.

Portrayal Man was launched in 2019. The nose behind this fragrance is Pierre Negrin. Top note is Violet Leaves; middle note is Vetiver; base note is Cade oil.The fifth chapter of the second cycle of the Amouage narrative by Creative Director Christopher Chong, Portrayal is a manifestation of a person’s orientation to him or herself. A reflection of his or her unique authenticity, it is about breaking free from the cages of solitude society sets around people because their truths are often seen as shockingly unconventional.Portrayal embodies an artist’s ability to reconnect fragments from different times and places. When society is barren, they are able to transport themselves and immerse in the freedom of rebellion that can be compared to London’s Roaring 1920’s and New York’s grooving 1980’s. With the flamboyant, glamorous and often disaffected companionship of Bright Young People, the artists lose themselves. Desperately seeking something to fill the void, they synergies with art, culture and themselves in order to recreate something infinitely indefinable.“A person who dares to defy the norms of their society, Portrayal is for the bold,” says Chong. “It is inspired by times of dramatic social change and the people who pushed beyond the limits of mass culture during their times. It is a reflection of the birth of a new age and the freedoms that come with it.”Portrayal Man is an olfactive depiction of 1920s bohemian culture. Its woody and leather aroma exudes an air of exquisite audacity. It is about the arrogance and social tension in the world’s cultural discourse. With Vetiver at its heart and top notes of Violet Leaves, Portrayal Man emits a dandy yet masculine impression. Its light spicy facet enriches its woody base of Cade, allowing the fragrance to illustrate an enlightening energy that is unforgettable.Amouage’s signature glass crystal bottles are introduced in an iridescent pearl finish adorned with a blue Swarovski crystal for Portrayal. The boxes are a delicate dusty blue with an elegant art deco inspired jacquard.Portrayal Man is available as a 50ml and 100ml Eau de Parfum from April 2019.

In 2015, the Candy Kiss Collection was introduced, consisting of the three original scents in practical mini bottles of 20 ml.Prada Candy Kiss, the new fragrance, channels the addictive nature of the Candy composition and enhances its characteristic scent of musk. Inspired by obsession and repetition, Prada Candy Kiss is designed to re-activate emotions and impressions. It evolved from the idea of creating a loop of sensations out of a single signature note wrapped around the body.Musk in its signature purity is omnipresent in the composition; from the upper notes to the base. It evokes delicate white cotton in a sensual fragrant cloud, enriched with uplifting notes of vanilla and orange blossom. The fragrance is developed by Daniela (Roche) Andrier.The face of the campaign shot by Steven Meisel is model Lexi Boling. The fragrance will be available in bottles of 30, 50 and 80 ml.

Top notes are Blood Orange, Tangerine, Ginger and Mint; middle notes are Coffee, Cinnamon and Black Pepper; base notes are Patchouli, Vanilla and Tonka Bean.After irresistible and very intense aromas of coffee, precious wood, masculine leather, Cuban tobacco and sweet spices which marked previous versions of the famous A*Men, positioning them successfully in the world of fragrances, this year Mugler tingles the imagination with luminous citruses blended with the popular composition of the original perfume. By creating a harmony of aromas with the accent on juicy, luminous and optimistic citruses Mugler introduces a new, strong version which perfectly combines layers and continues to surprise us regardless of the numerous editions and versions.The composition of the latest edition THIERRY MUGLER A*MEN ULTRA ZEST introduces a new dose of juiciness, tartness and strong accords of red orange and tangerine cooled additionally by mint along with tart-lemonish ginger in the opening. As the composition develops, we will feel fine aromas of coffee (repeated from numerous version of the original) blended with sweet spicy accords of cinnamon and black pepper. A game of warm, bright and cold notes stretches all the way to the base created of warm and deep notes of vanilla, patchouli and tonka. The latest fragrance of the house of Thierry Mugler results in a top quality woody composition spiced well with a game of warm and cold spices and refreshed with citruses, evoking the pleasant feeling of summer mornings and the first rays of the sun tingling and warming our skin. The perfumers of the composition are Jacques Huclier and Quintin Bisch of Givaudan.The new flacon of fragrance A*Men Ultra Zest repeats the design of previous editions and this time it arrives in a strong orange color with a star iridescent in shades of orange to yellow.

Being allowed to become an ambassador for the new Burberry fragrance feels particularly special and personal.To me, lionesses represent female unity and strength. They are confident and move together. Much like them, we stand on the shoulders of the women who came before us and those who bolster us throughout our own lives. To me, this image is a real source of empowerment.” - Emma Mackey, Burberry Beauty AmbassadorBurberry unveils the new Burberry Goddess Eau de Parfum, a unique aromatic fragrance for women. The launch is supported by a campaign featuring British-French actress and new ambassador for Burberry Beauty, Emma Mackey.The campaign presents a story of self-discovery inspired by the collective strength and power of the pride of lionesses. Created with live footage of lionesses in their natural environment and the latest CGI technology, Burberry creates an imaginary world where Emma Mackey and the pride come together as one.Embodying the spirit of the Burberry Goddess Eau de Parfum, Emma channels the strength of the pride, igniting the power within to discover her inner confidence and ascend the peak ahead of her. Echoing Shygirl in the overlaid vocals, ‘one of me, but I’m not the only one, we are many burning like the sun’, the lionesses represent the collective power of female strength and support and the fact that together, we can all discover our inner goddess and achieve the extraordinary.A unique gourmand aromatic fragrance led by a powerful trio of distinct vanillas. Collected by hand, the beans dry in the sun for five to seven weeks. They are then stored in wooden boxes to mature and develop their sweet signature aroma.“My initial goal for Burberry Goddess was to expand upon the common use of vanilla to deliver a new kind of rich olfactive experience. For this purpose, I used three distinct types of vanilla extraction. The first is a vanilla infusion, which provides the brightest, woody vanilla possible. Then I used Firgood™ , also known as vanilla caviar, for the first time in a fragrance. This innovative new ingredient adds a sweet, rich, and animalic vanilla. Lastly, vanilla absolute is darker and richer, enhancing the fragrance with a mysterious, milky aspect."  - Amandine Clerc-Marie, Master Perfumer.During the process of creating the perfect vanilla accord, the precious vanilla was wrapped with notes of bright Lavender Diva essence from Provence and earthy notes of cocoa and ginger roots, creating an aromatic balance to each vanilla.Olfactive PyramidTop: Vanilla Infusion and LavenderHeart: Vanilla CaviarBase: Vanilla AbsoluteFamily: Gourmand Aromatic Marking Burberry’s first-ever refillable fragrance, the bottle boasts an elegant design.

Guided by his brightness, the lion leaps from the sky in search of the world’s most precious ingredients. Knowing that resinous incense brings opulence to those who possess it, the lion jumps to the Arabic peninsula where Olibanum grows. Here, the noble creature encounters the tears of weeping trees, the bark exuding an unexpected, spicy scent that warms his heart. A symphony of balsamic resin traverses continents through golden winds, beckoning the lion to return to his homeland, Africa. As he follows the scent to yet another tree, he encounters the balsamic nectar of myrrh and its liquorice smoky undertones that liberate his soul. To sweeten his journey back to the moon, the lion garlands his mane in a blood-red blackcurrant accord. With the promise of dawn nearing, harmony returns as the lion resumes his position in the sky. Happy with the lion’s fabled journey, the Gucci alchemist carefully encases the fruity, ambery elixir– and its night-sky-inspired story – in a black lacquered bottle. Much like the alchemist's ability to transform all that he touches into newfound wonders, this unisex Gucci fragrance is manufactured using alcohol made from 100% recycled carbon emissions.Capturing the spirit of nature and distilling it into exquisite elixirs, The Alchemist’s Garden collection is composed of customisable Gucci fragrances intended to be layered together.Each olfactory creation draws on a hero ingredient that changes and magnifies its character when worn with other Gucci scents.The beauty of alchemy lies in the transformation: layered aromas that become new expressions of art and unfold the magic of unseen worlds.The Gucci Heart of Leo unisex Gucci Eau de Parfum offers six recommended layering combinations, each designed to bring out the richness and opulence of its warm facets captured by its golden mane.Create a warm incense with Gucci The Eyes of The Tiger.When applied with Gucci The Heart of Leo, the blend of Incense, Myrrh & Oriental captivates with its golden intensity.Envision a floral tapestry woven with the opulent Damask Rose essence of Gucci A Reason to Love.Incense, Myrrh & Rose-infused Oud Accord summon sultry depths, revealing a gourmand and floral bouquet of aromas.|Add a touch of sweetness to the Myrrh with Gucci A Chant for the Nymph.Infuse floral undertones into Incense & Myrrh with the Frangipani accord to create a sweet incense.Enhance the Gucci fragrance’s rich character with Gucci A Forgotten Rose Perfumed Oil.A fresh Rose combined with Incense & Myrrh enriches the composition with its symphony of warm and fresh aromas.Envelop yourself in the magic of the night with Gucci Moonlight Serenade Acqua Profumata.A Musky Lavender invigorates the ambery blend of Incense & Myrrh, infusing a sense of freshness into the composition.Unveil the richness of the ambery facets with Gucci A Forgotten Rose Perfumed Oil and Gucci Moonlight Serenade Acqua Profumata.Rose & Lavender introduce floral hints to the Incense & Myrrh in this ambery aromatic olfactory creation.

Thrill seekers the world over have been seduced into indulging in guilty pleasures. Now, in the dark and mysterious Gucci Guilty Black, the story becomes still more compelling, giving it a new, more passionate and more daring edge. A sequel and a new chapter.Creative Director Frida Giannini remarks: “These characters fascinate us as they are taken on a life of their own.

The Guilty Black lovers bring out the most thrilling sides of each other: alone they are magnificent, together irrepressible.

We added an evocative red glass for the female fragrance, green for the male, as a tribute to the timeless Gucci web stripe.”The imagery through which the house has brought Gucci Guilty to the world has captured attention: a spectacular combination of director Frank miller’s film noir and Frida Giannini’s sensuality.

It is meant for the “worldly and refined” man “who demands the very best."

Its initial notes are inspired by the look and feel of a handmade suit; there are accords of Calabrian bergamot, Tunisian orange blossom, French lavender and aniseed. The heart is eclectic, spicy and textured, including notes of nutmeg from Sri Lanka, water lily, juniper berries, plum and cinnamon. The base is luxurious and sophisticated, made of labdanum, patchouli, leather and amber.“One further ingredient is required: the man. For a suit is merely a beautiful silhouette until its owner wears it. It is only then—when worn—that it becomes something more. Similarly, the perfume’s refined leather and rich spices combine with the warmth of the skin, the Made to Measure man’s character, and the style in which he wears it.”“Made to Measure is presented in an haute parfumerie quality glass bottle, weighty and statuesque... The color scheme is the distinguished slate and pearl gray of a bespoke suit and shirt button. Like every Made to Measure garment, the bottle bears the signature of house founder Guccio Gucci, here inscribed in jet enamel. Each flacon bears a hand-brushed—thus individually finished—solid metal cap, in an exclusive golden color, featuring the house’s famous horsebit sitting prominently aloft it. The box is adorned with Gucci’s Diamante pattern, which dates back to the 1930s and reflects the house’s heritage. It also boasts a muted gold and gunmetal variation of the iconic Gucci web stripe.”The face of the perfume is actor, director and writer James Franco.

The cut-out shapes of the puppets sometimes include translucent color or other types of detailing. Various effects can be achieved by moving both the puppets and the light source. A talented puppeteer can make the figures appear to walk, dance, fight, nod and laugh.KARAGOZ (meaning “black eye” in Turkish) and HACIVAT (shortened in time from "Hacı İvaz" meaning "İvaz the Pilgrim"), ZENNE (the common name of the generally beautiful and flirty women featuring in various plays) are the lead characters of the traditional Turkish shadow play, popularized during the Ottoman period and then spread to most nation states that comprised the Ottoman Empire and most prominently in Turkey and Greece. The creative directors Mert Güzel and Murat Katran dreamed of bringing the legend of Karagoz & Hacivat into the today’s world. Under the inspiration of their playful characters, the perfume trilogy has been created together with the perfumer Jorge Lee. Just like the theme of these shadow plays, the main objective of NISHANE was to emphasize the contrasting interaction of the people that we can see in every single culture.HACIVAT is a tribute to elegance, competence, and love of art.ZENNE is a tribute to beauty, self-confidence, and flirtation.KARAGOZ is a tribute to wittiness, straightforwardness and sincerity” — press release of the brand.

To those who know that time flies so fast that life must be lived intensely and celebrated to the hilt.Living dangerously has its limits, and disenchantment is inevitable. When the party ends and the smokescreen falls, lost illusions resurface. A tragic and fascinating reality check.""Quick, quick, the world is ending! Our very existence needs urgent tending.Amid the roar of the cannons, the champagne flows. Corks in the air, could they be aflame?Beneath the smokescreen, life is a decadent game." - Serge LutensAvailable in 50 and 100 ml.		['Cacao', 'Rum', 'Smoke', 'Tobacco', 'Woody Notes']	[]	[]

L'orpheline was launched in 2014.1. Yet another girl!Yes, if you believe that she is the abandoned part of me. Child, I have cut the world in two. On the one hand, a girl, The Vanquished – not the loser! - and more precisely, that which germinated in her and which in myself, I raised; and on the other, a boy, The Victor. For a child, the world comes down to three people: himself, his mother and his father. Without everyone making such a clear-cut choice as mine, each one will be dependent on it throughout his life.2. Did your choice present itself as the mother?Not the mother, her wound; I bore it. It is undeniably an identification. As for each and every one of us, I owe my life to chance. The famous throw of the dice appears exemplary to me – it is a sacred number – it is the one which leads us there where we should have been born or not to have been. I shall not recall the significant episodes of my destiny but, between what was and what I felt, the difference was greater. However, the child is the clairvoyant: he foresees. Since I accorded all the qualities of the feminine to the wound, she named me.3. From now on, should we understand that the masculine was denied in you?From what to my eyes was officially required: the army, authority, power, order, moralism, yes. I was at war with the Male: Maleficence. It can be expected that from this moment, I invent a woman and bring us up to date, it is the baptism of blood.4. Coming back to the orphan girl. Is this you?No, originally it was a virgin territory, it attracted me but I didn’t recognise myself there; this territory which I denied was that of men. My mother, she was the wrath and I, her son, its revenge.5. And the father, where is he?The father is the declared enemy. I was hatred on Earth, on Father. Of the mother I was the figurehead, and of the father the assassin. The wound did not heal. I could blind myself but I could see: the father was immortal. From him I keep the feminine which he betrayed.6. How did you recover the road to perfume in this labyrinth?It is the memory, forgiveness and like this, what we have today, it was able to survive: From the dust. It is not only in the feminine but it also has no plural. It is the wake of my life, that which remains when all has disappeared. It is the invisible which, veil after veil, there where it is forgotten, fades into grey.—Serge Lutens	['Has nuances in musky and incense fragrances', 'Unisex', 'Good for cooler seasons', 'Has a unique and daring quality', 'Has warmth and comfort in its scent', 'Longevity is excellent', 'Can be considered sexy', 'Sillage is strong', 'May not be for everyone', 'May come off as cold or austere on some people', 'Can have a sad or lonely feel', 'Has a heavy metallic smell on some people', 'May have an overwhelming scent on some people', 'May have a synthetic or artificial smell', 'May remind some people of toothpaste or potpourri', 'May have a pungent, cloying pine wood scent on some people']	['Incense', 'Musk']	[]	[]	very weak: 4%; weak: 8%; moderate: 42%; long lasting: 35%; eternal: 11%	very weak: 20%; intimate: 59%; strong: 15%; enormous: 6%

Now that would be divine!In French, the words beauty, war, religion, fear, life and death are all feminine, while challenge, combat, art, love, courage, suicide and vertigo remain within the realm of the masculine.Clearly, Death is a Woman. Her absence imposes a strange state of widowhood. Yet beauty cannot reach fulfilment without crime.The chrysanthemum is the sole pretext for writing these lines.Turning gravesites held in perpetuity over to Life – a familiar of these haunts – the chrysanthemum invites Death to leave the cemetery and offer us its flower.De profundis clamavi."

It is a night when one trembles to boldly lower the sacred cross against the heart, to aid in the passage to fatherhood.So, as a crucifix, that night I pick up Hyperion, a novel by Dan Simmons. This is a masterful science fiction saga that celebrates the infinite legend of the French Jesuit priest Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, who was a 20th-century researcher, paleontologist, theologian and philosopher.And I read, pacified, until the reflections of the dawn, until the first golden rays of the East. I read the future of man, the celebration of transhumanism and the qualitative leap of humanity enhanced by machine. I have rarely loved a book this much, I have rarely loved a thinker this much.I read that night what a man thought he saw in the tombs of time.I am a lover of words in the service of materials when they come together to make poetry in the bottom of our bottles; thus, a few years ago, I bring up the work of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin to one of the last living vestiges of the triumphant 20th century, and I ask him: - "Then Teilhard de Chardin, precursor of genius?" A look, a silence and for the answer four unexpected words, four words whispered by my father: "GHOST IN THE SHELL".This is the act of birth that makes the spirit of perfume. The rest is poetry to live on the skin.Pierre Teilhard de Chardin died in 1955, but his spirit continues to travel. This fragrance extends it through an alliance with the Japanese artist Shirow Masamune to transcend the spirit of Earth.By mixing biotech and natural materials, this perfume silently celebrates the wake of the future and also whispers of a day to come, by providence or chance, when humanity is reunited and organized. A day when all consciousness is summoned by the infosphere to constitute a superior being and pass from the inert to the living. As the molecules assemble to make the living, we will then make a qualitative leap that becomes the starting point and arrival of transhumanism.This perfume is the future. It comes to us from the 20th century.Ghost in the Shell, a perfume that speaks of the human phenomenon and its paradox, a perfume to wear on oneself ab libitum, at one’s pleasure. A perfume as a propagation towards the other, that makes you the axis and the arrow of evolution; modern, indeed! From the bottom of the matter, rise up."  - Etienne de SwardtTop notes: Aqual™, Yuzu HE, Hexyl Acetate (MANE Biotech)Heart notes: Jasmin absolute, Mugane™, Milky Skin AccordBase notes: Moss Accord, Vinyl Gaiacol (MANE Biotech), Orcanox™	['Unique and otherworldly scent', 'Approachable and weird', 'Interesting opening with milky musk and sharp florals', 'Clean and fresh smelling', 'Mesmerizing and captivating', 'Good longevity and sillage', 'Great for nostalgia or memory associations', 'Good for fans of Blade Runner or Chobits', 'Not suitable for blind buying', 'Depends on personal biology and skin chemistry', 'Chemical and synthetic smell', "Some reviewers find it disappointing compared to the brand's descriptions", 'May smell like hairspray or cheap soap to some people', 'May induce gag reflex for some people', 'Acrid and musky dry down', 'Not for everyone, may turn ultra masculine on some people']	['Aqual', 'Yuzu', 'Hexyl acetate']	['Milk', 'Skin', 'Jasmine', 'Mugane']	['Orcanox™', 'Vinyl Guaiacol', 'Moss']	very weak: 2%; weak: 11%; moderate: 59%; long lasting: 24%; eternal: 4%	very weak: 28%; intimate: 62%; strong: 9%; enormous: 1%

Fat Electrician Semi-Modern Vetiver was launched in 2009. The nose behind this fragrance is Antoine Maisondieu.Fat Electrician was presented in 2009 by perfumer Antoine Maisondieu. The fragrance is based on vetiver notes with light, metallic nuances of olive leaves, creamy touch of vanilla, opoponax and myrrh in base notes of the perfume. The fragrance is available as 50ml edp.His beauty would have been his greatest asset. One imagines he was raised in the big air of Texas, his soft skin scrubbed by ears of wheat, his eyelashes curled by grappling with grace against a blinding sun. A Steve McQueen lost on city asphalt. A fisherman without a line, he was made to be hooked by others, to believe in his fate without knowing it, to wreak havoc and forget it over time. Youth for women-of-a-certain-age, stock for late-night parties, a partner to accompany the wealthy of Palm Peach on nature walks, his splendor is consumed in the service of others. Now, a Fat Electrician in New Jersey, his talent depleted in his sexual decline. To celebrate this beauty which cannot be recaptured, a splendid vetiver is required - an ode to bygone eroticism. Antoine Maisondieu has willed him white, metallic, silver like the ancestral green of olive leaves. But also sweet, demure, addictive like a chestnut cream – vanilla bean, opoponax and myrrh in the bottom notes. Intensely concentrated, resinous, flawlessly unrefined, it conveys a sensuality of contradiction. Because all beauty carries within itself the knowledge that it will not last.

A mixture like miscellanea that clash between words and materials to explain just a little, without explaining too much, the why of a perfume. Frustration.  During a summer a few years ago, while walking on the Ramblas in Barcelona, I listened to a song by Rare Bird, an English band of progressive rock from the 70s. The song was called Sympathy, and the chorus was "and sympathy is what you need my friend, and sympathy is what you need my friend cause there's not enough love to go ‘round, No, there's not enough love to go ‘round...". And there, suddenly, with the richness of a whole psychoanalytical past (according to Lacan), this same past which sometimes foists my strength on others or sometimes my great weakness on myself, there emerged from the refrain a word stronger than sympathy. It planted its black flag of melancholy in the heart of my mind, and issued forth a word more correct, more vast, more true, more sincere, more useful since forged in the experience of life: FRUSTRATION.  And then to sing again in my head the substituted refrain "...And frustration is what you need my friend, and frustration is what you need my friend."    Frustration, the eldest daughter of renunciation and the sister of perfume, since perfume proceeds like frustration in the game of love.  It gives by taking up, a fullness never satisfied, an enjoyment started but never achieved, an infinite movement of desire without completion, without apotheosis, an instillation that excites, seduces, lulls, dominates and annoys like a Bolero by Ravel. Frustration.  So take a vanilla bean, a garden rose with swollen red petals, some old rum exploding with amber woods, a bourbon vetiver, bring each of these materials to your senses. Frustration.  Breathe, taste the circulation of the unheard of beans, delectable fermentation but never enough, where one asks for more, all nostrils out, ... "More, more, let us take your redness deeper, and become this animal with the dull mind of the child who wants to enjoy and devour even more this chestnut wood, this cinnamon or this vetiver until bursting, and then to bathe satiated in the poetry of the smell." Frustration.  This is the love game of perfume, this is the game of love according to Musset, Shakespeare or Racine. And it is so much the better because satisfaction kills whereas desire makes you live by creating movement through the ever renewed distance, so as to never consume like a homicidal ogre. Frustration.  Happy are the consumers of desire, unhappy the consumers of enjoyment.  Frustration, a perfume to awaken the strong child in the fragile adult or the fragile child in the too-strong adult, a perfume for a regressive journey to the dominion of vanilla, rum and vetiver.  An extraordinary State of Orange that you have to reach in order to live passionately between the child and the adult with the memory of what’s missing.

Jasmin et Cigarette is also the slightly jasminy smell of a woman’s skin when she exposes her freshness to the dark seduction of night. A hazy atmosphere. The reminder of a fantasy, of an indelible trail she leaves on a dress at the break of day or in the intimate memory of the man who made love to her. It is elegance seen by Gainsbourg, the woman from the 80’s who smokes Gitane cigarettes and wears jeans and who, with astounding naturalness, claims her sensuality as a right. Transparency in sophistication, just a trace of jasmine mingled to the so far neglected smell of a cigarette. Jasmin et Cigarette is the twilight zone, the banned, addiction.

Masculine tenseness frees a rush of adrenalin in a cascade of high-pitched aldehydic notes. The sensation of freshness is gripping.

The powdered top note evokes a woman who dresses for seduction – a soft trail of lipstick, the rustling of lace. The intimate ritual of a femme fatale who sees right through the fragile armour of men. Her sophistication is intriguing, as is the commerce she makes of her body.

Tilda Swinton Like This was launched in 2010. The nose behind this fragrance is Mathilde Bijaoui.Etat Libre d’Orange launches a new fragrance in March 2010, second celebrity perfume in a row, this time inspired by the English actress Tilda Swinton. Her favorite scent is the scent of home, so she wanted a fragrance that will be a magical potion with that kind of smell. Mathilde Bijaoui created for her a composition of yellow tangerine, ginger, pumpkin, immortelle, Moroccan neroli, Grass rose, vetiver, heliotrope and musk.It is available as 50 ml EDP."I have always located my favourite fragrances at the doorways of kitchens, in the heart of a greenhouse, at the bottom of a garden. Scent means place to me : place and state of mind - even state of grace. Certainly state of ease. My favourite smells are the smells of home, the experience of the reliable recognisable after the exotic adventure: the regular - natural - turn of the seasons, simplicity and softness after the duck and dive of definition in the wide, wide world.When Mathilde Bijaoui first asked me what my own favourite scent in a bottle might contain, I described a magic potion that I could carry with me wherever I went that would hold for me the fragrance - the spirit - of home. The warm ginger of new baking on a wood table, the immortelle of a fresh spring afternoon, the lazy sunshine of my grandfather's summer greenhouse, woodsmoke and the whisky peat of the Scottish Highlands after rain. I told her about a bottle of spirit, something very simple, to me : something almost indescribable, so personal it should be. The miracle is that Mathilde made it.The great Sufi poet Rumi wrote :If anyone wants to know what "spirit" is,or what "God’s fragrance" means,lean your head toward him or her.Keep your face there close.Like this.This is possibly my favourite poem of all time.It restores me like the smoke/rain/gingerbread/ greenhouse my scent-sense is fed by. It is a poem about simplicity, about human-scaled miracles. About trust. About home.In my fantasy there is a lost chapter of Alice in Wonderland - after the drink saying Drink Me, after the cake pleading Eat Me - where the adventuring, alien, Alice, way down the rabbit hole, far from the familiar and maybe somewhat homesick - comes upon a modest glass with a ginger stem reaching down into a pale golden scent that humbly suggests : Like This…"Tilda SwintonComposition: Yellow tangerine, ginger, immortelle flower, Moroccan Neroli, Grasse rose, vetyver, heliotrope, musks..."

I am Trash - Les Fleurs du Déchet was launched in 2018. The nose behind this fragrance is Daniela Andrier.By virtue of my mother, I am the son of a forgotten coast, far away in New Caledonia. At the mouth of the Ngoye live the Borindi, who have known since the twilight of the gods the great principle of harmony with Mother Nature: to take from her no more than is necessary while preserving for tomorrow. They understand the future of mankind, and in the shade of the niaouli tree and jacarandas in bloom, they guide our first steps into this new direction for Etat Libre d’Orange.In the early years of this new millennium, when my children were young and I was a hopeful thirty-year-old, I took them to see an animated film called Titan AE. I learned by heart the introduction, which went something like this :  "Once in a while, man unlocks a secret so profound that it can change the universe : fire, electricity, atom splitting. At the dawn of the 21st century, we invented the Titan program..."There is a jumble of romantic and titanic science fiction poetry that emerges from the slow, sure, and inevitable rocking of wastewaters in the industrial cycle. We want to make this perfume a messenger, in service not only to the survival of the species which results from seduction, but above all in service to the planet where our own miasmas must reflect beauty.We believe that a new post-religious "jihad" is approaching, coming from an often disillusioned and polluting West, and echoing a new animistic era. Those who have committed crimes against the environment are repenting, and democracies are acknowledging nature as the sacred focal point, meant to be shared. The beliefs of the primitive and ancient tribes are back, and demand our full allegiance. This perfume will carry a universal message: that which is dirty must reflect the beautiful. "...and wash me clean of the bluish wine stains and the splashes of vomit, Carrying away both rudder and anchor." - Arthur Rimbaud, The Drunken Boat.Les Fleurs du Déchet represents a passage to the adulthood of Sécrétions Magnifiques. It is a counter-revolution for Etat Libre d’Orange, still noisy and disruptive, but ultimately functional.Givaudan, Ogilvy and Etat Libre d’Orange have created a three-fold company in the service of Mother Nature, to offer her a bouquet of forgiveness and let everyone know – loudly and quickly – that soon it will be too late. Dear world : Do not throw anything away because at the bottom of our trash lies the fermented distillation of great love. The garbage trucks hold flowers that can still bleed, peels and rinds that can still give. The noxious exhalations have honey notes that can merge with the earth. And there are so many floating concretions, the trash that is thrown into the sea, and the natural waste, the ambergris, mystical symbols, the attitudes of primitive tribes – these must now be reprocessed.To paraphrase and distort Alan Paton : "Cry, my beloved planet", for the unborn child ; let him not love the earth too deeply, for it is slipping away. So before it’s too late, let us (s)pray to the god of waste, our dear lord of leftovers.The notes of the composition: Rose NeoAbsolute, apple essence, Cedarwood Atlas, Sandalore, Agikalawood, Iso E Super.

Top notes are Eucalyptus, Melon, Bergamot and Galbanum; middle notes are Coconut, Tuberose, Jasmine, Orange Blossom and Ylang-Ylang; base notes are White Musk, Animal notes and Amber.Carnal Flower or forbidden flower is a fragrance with the scent of tuberose. Tuberose is a beautiful and dangerous flower. In some cultures, it is not allowed for young women to feel its intoxicating scent after sunset. Tuberose is a symbol of forbidden pleasure, hiding its passionate, sensual character behind its fresh, white, floral face. Its intoxicating scent seduces many perfumers; Frederic Malle and creator Dominique Ropion tried to repeat this scent in their particular way. Frederic Malle was inspired for Carnal Flower during his visits to California, where everything smells like gardenia and tuberose.Dominique Ropion worked on development of the formula for more than two years. The perfume contains a larger dose of tuberose absolute than any other perfume. The composition opens with heavy, green notes of citrus leaves and branches. As tuberose develops, the green nuance passes into a note of camphora, which softens the opulent flowers unintrusively. Fruity nuances of melon and coconut add light and slightly gourmet sound to the composition and do not attract attention. The muse for this perfume was Frederic Malle’s aunt, famous actress Candice Bergen, who acted in the movie Carnal Knowledge with Jack Nicholson.The top notes contain: bergamot, melon and eucalyptus.The middle notes include: ylang-ylang, jasmine, tuberose, Salicylates (natural, toxic product of herbal origin, a sort of a herbal feromone which is used by plants as a warning).The base encompasses: tuberose absolute, orange blossom absolute, coconut and musk.The perfume was created in 2005.

Spices in the composition contribute to elegant, masculine turn (cloves and cinnamon), along with sandalwood and a new sort of white musk, which retains long-lasting fresh and sophisticated effect.What is the most interesting is that the formula contains natural notes strengthened with a new technology.

Narciso Rodriguez For Her was launched in 2003. Narciso Rodriguez For Her was created by Christine Nagel and Francis Kurkdjian. Top notes are African Orange Flower, Osmanthus and Bergamot; middle notes are Musk and Amber; base notes are Vetiver, Patchouli and Vanille. This perfume is the winner of 2 awards: FiFi Award Fragrance Of The Year Women`s Nouveau Niche 2004 and FiFi Award Fragrance Of The Year Women`s Nouveau Niche 2007.Young and very modern American designer of Cuban origins Narciso Rodriguez has launched his first fragrances which has instantly become the hit in the US, and not only there. The new modern aroma is aimed at the modern and free woman, who is aware of her sexuality. Popularity of this fragrance (regardless of its unusual composition and a heavy character, and perhaps exactly because of that) is easy to explain because it reflects a desire of every woman to attract and seduce, and this fragrance has openly sexual character. Unusual lustful composition is created with the sensual musk in its centre, surrounded by orange, osmanthus and amber. The base unites vanilla, amber and vetiver. Intensive sharp scent with hidden and scarcely discernible densely-sweet nuance in the centre later turns into a soft and balmy powder. The aggression disappears and the fragrance becomes tame and gentle.At first, in 2004 it was launched as EDT in a black bottle in pink outer box. Then in 2006 the EDP was created in a pink bottle and black outer box. The composition was changed, despite the fact that the musk note has remained in the centre of the composition. EDP has rose note in the top. The trace has become more mysterious and rich, thanks to exotic woods – patchouli and sandalwood. Both variances of the fragrance can be described as floral chypre with intensive musk nuance, only the first one is sharper and more aggressive, while the second one is sweeter and softer. The creators of these fragrances are Christine Nagel and Francis Kurkdjian.

Top note is Bergamot; middle notes are May Rose, Peach, Heliotrope, Ylang-Ylang, Geranium, Neroli and Jasmine; base notes are Vanilla, Musk, Sandalwood, Orris, Ambergris and Patchouli.Soft powdery whispers of Orris and Musk dances around a central note of elegant Rose de Mai. But all is not what it seems as an explosion of juicy Peach – nature’s forbidden fruit - hints at something more mysterious to sink your teeth into. Beneath this portrait of refined femininity, something deeper and more exotic weaves its way out of the shadows. A damp, earthy accent of Patchouli brings a carnal edge to the sensuality of Sandalwood, which is taken to dizzying heights with the animalic impulse of Orientalgris. At once familiar and yet utterly ambiguous, the inability to put your finger on who that woman is, is the enigma itself.An elegantly seductive perfume, Enigma has the magical ability to envelope the wearer in its exotic charm and enchant any who fall into its path. Based around the seductive qualities of Peach and Sandalwood, a swathe of this voluptuous fruit contributes a velvety-smooth sweetness to the depth of this legendary skin-mimicking wood. A touch of citrus Bergamot alongside vibrant Heliotrope and Geranium lend a light freshness which is made rich and indulgent by a heart of Rose and Ylang Ylang, whilst intensely sensual notes of Orientalgris and Musk linger in the shadows and form a perfume that gives the wearer a notable je ne sais quoi.

Creamy white flowers coax the sweetness of Sandalwood and Vanilla into a siren’s song, where skin-like Orris and Musk tempt you to lean in a little closer. Just remember, you have been warned…Rather than warning those who smell it to stay away, Danger is the type of scent that invites them to come closer. Displaying a hidden moreishness, the juice of four zesty Citrus fruits melt into the velvety sweetness of Peach and Tonka Bean, giving any who smell it a subliminal invite of something worth sinking their teeth into. Prominent aphrodisiac notes of indulgent Vanilla and warm, creamy Jasmine blend into Ylang Ylang and a knowing blush of Rose to create an intensely seductive floral heart. The sensuality and depth of Sandalwood forms the bed upon which this entire fragrance lays, whilst the animalic impulse of Musk beckons a flirtatious “come hither”.
